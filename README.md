### Installing operating system without Windowing System
To understand Windowing System, it is useful to see how to install it and  
configure it with an average Linux kernel distribution. For this time around,  
Ubuntu by Canonical undoubtably have biggest appearance in media these days  
among various governmental institutions, and have grown some kind of community. 

Currently Ubuntu mainly offers **Ubuntu Desktop** and **Ubuntu Server** variants,  
if it is not already obvious, **Ubuntu Desktop** already includes Windowing System  
and Desktop Environment. That means if we insist to learn about the Windowing System  
we should consider to begin with installing a variant of **Ubuntu Server**.

It might look counter intuitive, but having Windowing system already preinstalled,  
might not be very effective way for beginners to get the sense of what exactly it is.

To install operating system, you surely have to download it.  
And here I provide you with the links, choose wisely:
* Canonical Ubuntu Desktop https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
* Canonical Ubuntu Server https://ubuntu.com/download/server

newly downloaded Ubuntu Server installation image. The installation image happens to be  
named this way:

  Which indicates:
    * Distribution Version: 19.04
    * Processor Architecture: amd64

Once you found the installation image that you downloaded. You have to consider booting it,  
Booting simply means launching it. And there are some ways to do it.
* You can launch it from USB device such as famous: 
  * USB flash drives
  * Portable HDD drives
